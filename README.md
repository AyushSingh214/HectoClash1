# HectoClash

A project made by....

## Problem Statement

Traditional mental math games often lack competitive and interactive elements, reducing user engagement and limiting their educational value. Existing platforms may offer puzzles and challenges but fail to provide real-time head-to-head competition, which can significantly enhance motivation and learning. The absence of live competition, rankings, and post-game analysis makes it difficult for users to track progress and improve their skills dynamically.

## About Hectoc

Hectoc, a mental calculation game, offers a unique challenge where players must strategically use mathematical operations on a six-digit sequence to reach 100. However, there is currently no competitive platform that enables real-time duels based on Hectoc, missing an opportunity to gamify learning in a stimulating way.

## Solution

 -  Players can compete in online duels:
    - First to 3 or 5 Solves
        - In this mode, players compete to be the first to solve 3 or 5 puzzles correctly.
        - The puzzles will appear one by one, and players must solve them as quickly as possible. 
    - Most solves in 5 minutes:
        - Players have 5 minutes to solve as many puzzles as possible.
        - Instead of direct competition against a single player, this format allows players to focus on efficiency and endurance.

 -  Battle Royale Arena
    This is a high-stakes, survival-style competition where multiple players enter, and every minute, the lowest 10-15% of players are eliminated. The game continues until only one player remains.

    How it Works: **FIX THIS**
    - All players start simultaneously.
    - The bottom 10-15% of performers are eliminated every minute.
    - The final 5 players enter a ‚Äúsudden death‚Äù phase, where one mistake results in elimination.


 - Engagement Features(Live Spectator Interaction)
    - Spectators watching a match can send emoji reactions and messages to encourage or players.
    - Boosts social engagement, making watching a match as exciting as playing.

 - Practice Mode
    - A structured progression system focusing on specific mathematical operations (addition, multiplication, pattern recognition, etc.).

## TechStack




## Before the Hackathon

When we initially came across this problem statement, we were immediately attracted to it since it brought together creativity, challenge, and technical skills from the real world. The concept of creating a multiplayer game that was not only enjoyable but also scalable was like the ideal opportunity to challenge ourselves and gain knowledge.

This was our first experience building a multiplayer game, and the learning curve was steep‚Äîbut incredibly rewarding. We delved deep into what makes multiplayer experiences responsive and smooth, investigating technologies such as WebSockets and Pub/Sub systems to manage real-time communication between players, because the problem statement itself focused so much on scalability, we chose to do more than simply create the game‚Äîwe wanted to learn how to scale it. That brought us to Docker and Kubernetes, where we learned about containerization and orchestration and how they can be used to deploy and run applications in a production-ready, scalable manner.

We also learned Go (Golang), not only because it was among the preferred tech stack, but also because its concurrency model and performance made it an ideal choice for constructing efficient backend systems.

Even before the hackathon formally started, we had already gained a lot‚Äîranging from real-time systems and multiplayer architecture to scalable deployment techniques. That foundation played a big part in how we constructed and designed our project.


## Gameplay

## üìö What is Hectoc?

**Hectoc** is a game format created by Yusnier Viera where players are given a 6-digit sequence using digits 1‚Äì9 (e.g., `123456`). The goal is to insert any combination of operations (`+`, `-`, `√ó`, `√∑`, `^`) and parentheses between the digits ‚Äî without rearranging them ‚Äî to form a valid expression that evaluates to exactly 100.

‚úÖ **Example**:  
Input: `367626`  
Solution: `(36+76-2*6) = 100`

## üéÆ Gameplay Overview

- **Real-Time Duels**  
  Challenge another player to a live battle where both race against time to find the correct solution.

- **Dynamic Puzzle Generation**  
  Every match generates a unique six-digit sequence, ensuring no two duels are ever the same.

- **Leaderboards & Rankings**  
  Track wins, streaks, speed, and accuracy. Climb the ranks and prove your mental math mastery.

- **Spectator Mode**
  Watch ongoing duels, learn from top players, and cheer for your favorites.

- **Educational Insights** _
  Post-game feedback shows common mistakes, and time-based analytics for learning and improvement.
